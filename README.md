python3 code to retrieve all aerfoils from UIUC database 
ok, i agree, not the best way to do this, but i hope is helps you learn something new like:
1.open URL using urllib.request module
2.use regex to get airfoil data
3.save html (or .dat) in local drive
4.implement parallel programming using Pool()
